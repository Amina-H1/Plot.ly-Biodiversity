# Plot.ly-Biodiversity
An interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonise human navels.

A bar chart, bubble chart and a gauge chart are generated for each sample alongside the demographics. The charts and the deographic information are update each time a new test subject ID number is selected from the dropdown menu.
